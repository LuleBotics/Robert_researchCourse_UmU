3.1-3.4 Four different IMF Bz/SW speed conditions
For each of the four conditions: show the scatter plot and the corresponding colour map of BR-OPS-IPS tailBy induction coeffs separately for the two ranges of XGSM. Compare the coeffs (= interpretation). Select the figures so that the removed background tailBy option always matches the IMFBz direction. One could also show the plots for the range -20 to -10 RE first before division to the two ranges (additional work needed).
